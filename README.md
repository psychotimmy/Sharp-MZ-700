Various artefacts relating to the Sharp MZ-700

Last updated 31st August 2021

1. GNU BLAT 2000 (.wav and .mzf) - Sharp BASIC 1.0A game written for the Lymphoma Action gaming challenge, April 2021.

2. realfortran-en.pdf - Translation from German (with improvements) of the BBG RealFortan v1 compiler manual.

3. primes-rf.F90 - Prime number generator, suitable for use with the BBG RealFortran v1 compiler. Note - this is NOT a Fortan 90 dialect!

4. Sharp MZ-700 User Notes 1.pdf - Scan of the first edition of the SharpSoft USer Notes for the MZ-700.

5. Drinking game v2 (.mzf) - Sharp BASIC 1.0A program to solve the puzzle using a monte carlo simulation, August 2021.

6. Moonlander game v4 (.wav and .mzf) - Sharp BASIC 1.0A program implementing a moonlander game, inspired by the Usborne Books 'Spacegames' text-only version and one 
   implemented by @electron_greg (twitter) for the Commodore PET. This implementation shares no common code with either, other than Newtonian mechanics formulae!

Sharp MZ-700 emulators will work directly with the .mzf files stored here.

If you are fortunate enough to have access to the real thing with a tape deck, mzf files need to be converted into an audio file (.wav) first. MZFStudio - https://www.nachthacker.de/DownloadBereich.html - is excellent for this conversion (and will also convert .wav files into .mzf format).
