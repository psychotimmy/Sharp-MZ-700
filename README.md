Sharp MZ 700 stuff

Various artefacts relating to the Sharp MZ-700

Last updated 29th December 2021

1. GNU BLAT 2000 (.wav and .mzf) - Sharp BASIC 1.0A game written for the Lymphoma Action gaming challenge, April 2021.

2. realfortran-en.pdf - Translation from German (with improvements) of the BBG RealFortan v1 compiler manual.

3. primes-rf.F90 - Prime number generator, suitable for use with the BBG RealFortran v1 compiler. Note - this is NOT a Fortran 90 dialect!

4. Sharp MZ-700 User Notes 1.pdf - Scan of the first edition of the SharpSoft USer Notes for the MZ-700.

5. Drinking game v2 (.mzf) - Sharp BASIC 1.0A program to solve the puzzle using a monte carlo simulation, August 2021.

6. Moonlander game v4 (.wav and .mzf) - Sharp BASIC 1.0A program implementing a moonlander game, inspired by the Usborne Books 'Spacegames' text-only version and one 
   implemented by @electron_greg (twitter) for the Commodore PET. This implementation shares no common code with either, other than Newtonian mechanics formulae!

7. Advent of code 2021 (v6), day 25 (.mzf) - the sea cucumber problem. Sharp BASIC 1.0A program to solve the puzzle using two 2D character arrays. On a 10x10 grid, this 
   takes around 7 seconds per generation (around 50% less time with the S-BASIC Compiler). It occurs to me that there's potentially a much more efficient algorithm 
   that uses one array and simply considers the spaces. Yep - v7 (.mzf) implements this method and saves around a second per generation on a 10x10 grid. 

8. Sunrise v2 (.mzf) - Sharp BASIC 1.0A program to calculate sunrise and sunset times for any day at any position on the globe. Based on the code published in 
   Sky & Telescope, August 1994. (There is also a version of this with minimal changes for the RC2014 - https://github.com/psychotimmy/RC2014). 

Sharp MZ-700 emulators will work directly with the .mzf files stored here.

If you are fortunate enough to have access to the real thing with a tape deck, mzf files need to be converted into an audio file (.wav) first. MZFStudio - https://www.nachthacker.de/DownloadBereich.html - is excellent for this conversion (and will also convert .wav files into .mzf format).
